how to use:

1) sudo apt-get install cscope

2) copy cscope_maps.vim to $HOME/.vim/plugin

3) ./cscope_project.sh <your_project> <your_project_name>

  The step will obtain the file of cscope.out in the <your_project_name> dir. The <your_project_name> dir is in the dir
  of cscope_project.sh.

4) cp cp-example.sh cp-<your_project>.sh, modify it to let CSCOPE_DB path to your project's cscope.out, and source cp-eample.sh

5) run vim, ctrl + space + s/g/c/... enjoy cscope!!
